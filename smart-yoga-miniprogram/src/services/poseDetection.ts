  // TODO: Replace with actual call to the cloud AI function for pose detection.
  // This will involve:
  // 1. Preparing the image data (e.g., reading the file, base64 encoding, or uploading to a temporary cloud storage if required by the AI service).
  // 2. Constructing the request payload for the cloud AI service. This might include the image data (or its URL) and the poseId.
  // 3. Making the HTTP request (e.g., using Taro.request or a dedicated HTTP client library) to the cloud function endpoint.
  //    - Ensure proper authentication and error handling for the HTTP request.
  // 4. Handling the response:
  //    - Parsing the JSON response from the cloud function.
  //    - Checking for any errors returned by the AI service (e.g., image not clear, pose not recognized).
  // 5. Mapping the cloud service's response fields to the PoseScoreResponse interface.
  //    - If the cloud service returns data in a different structure, adapt it here.

  // Mock response generation:
  const mockScore = Math.floor(Math.random() * 31) + 70; // Random score between 70-100
  let mockFeedback = "姿势标准，请继续保持！"; // "Pose is good, keep it up!"
